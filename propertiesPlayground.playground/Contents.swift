 - Circle has an instance variable called  radius with a default value of 0.
 - In Swift, every instance variable is automatically a property.
 - So we have the possibility to add property observers.
 - In Swift there a two types of property observers:
       1. One is called before the new value is assigned(willSet)
       2. other one afterwards(didSet)

/* Computed Properties
 - computed properties donâ€™t have a stored value.
 - computed properties will be computed data when we are using,i.e calculated.
 - A computed property always needs a getter (for returning value)
 - If it lacks a setter, the property is called a read-only property.

     1. initialize the value
     2. initialize the value inside the init method
